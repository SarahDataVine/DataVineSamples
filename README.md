# Sarah Lawrence – Data & BI Portfolio

This portfolio showcases database and business intelligence projects I’ve developed,  
including consulting work completed through my company [**DataVine**](https://getdatavine.com).  

I specialize in **Access-to-SQL migrations, Power BI dashboards, and SQL development**

Each project demonstrates practical solutions for small-to-mid sized businesses — replacing spreadsheets and manual processes with scalable, reliable systems.
