# Engineering Production Database

## Project Overview
This project involved building and maintaining a custom database for a small engineering company. The goal was to track the entire production process, from procurement through manufacturing and quality control, in one unified system.

## Challenges
- Production data was siloed in spreadsheets, making it difficult to track materials and progress.  
- Quality checks were not consistently documented.  
- Procurement and manufacturing data werenâ€™t connected, leading to delays and missed insights.  

## Solution
- Designed a relational database in Microsoft Access to centralize procurement, manufacturing, and quality data.  
- Established data models to capture material usage, production schedules, and inspection results.  
- Created queries and reports to monitor production status, identify bottlenecks, and highlight quality trends.  
- Built forms for easy data entry, improving adoption by shop-floor employees.  
- Added validation rules to ensure accurate and complete records.  

## Results
- Provided management with visibility into the full production cycle.  
- Reduced delays by linking procurement and manufacturing data.  
- Improved quality tracking and accountability across the process.  
- Increased efficiency by replacing disconnected spreadsheets with a structured system.  

## Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Access  
- SQL (queries and reporting)  
- VBA automation for user forms and reports
