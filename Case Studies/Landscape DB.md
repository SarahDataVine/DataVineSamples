# Landscaping Business Database

## Project Overview
This project replaced a small landscaping companyâ€™s paper and spreadsheet system with a fully integrated database solution. The goal was to streamline operations, improve accuracy, and provide leadership with visibility into the business.

## Challenges
- Invoicing and payroll were handled manually, creating delays and errors.  
- Revenue tracking was inconsistent, making it difficult to forecast or measure profitability.  
- Multiple employees needed access to records, but files were not centralized.  

## Solution
- Designed and implemented a Microsoft Access front end with an Azure SQL back end for scalability and multi-user support.  
- Built data models covering invoicing, payroll, job management, procurement, and revenue tracking.  
- Developed Power BI dashboards to visualize revenue, costs, and job performance.  
- Added governance rules and validation checks to ensure consistent, accurate data entry.  
- Automated reporting, reducing manual effort and increasing reliability.  

## Results
- Enabled batch invoicing and faster payroll processing.  
- Improved accuracy of financial records and reduced duplication errors.  
- Provided real-time reporting for leadership, scaling the company from **$50K to $300K in annual revenue**.  
- Increased efficiency and collaboration across the business through multi-user access.
